# Migration Manifest (APPROVED 2026-06-21)

Consolidates design/presentation skills from the domain engines into design-system-skills.
**Model:** reference (not mirror). **Decisions locked:** website = move portable / keep
build-coupled; blended engineering skills = leave + reference (only tailwind & avalonia split);
execution = phased, safe-first. Source deletions happen only after the additive copy is verified.

Safety rules (from integration-plan.md): `git pull --ff-only` each source before touching it;
no per-skill stubs (the engine's trigger block is the single pointer); update counts after each
phase.

---

## PHASE 1 — clean, non-duplicated, standalone MOVES (low risk)

### From engineering-catalog (the `skills-web-dev` repository, relocated 2026-06-21) — 11 skills

| Source skill folder | → Destination group |
|---|---|
| `skills\frontend-ux\design-audit` | 03-web-and-ui-design |
| `skills\frontend-ux\healthcare-ui-design` | 03-web-and-ui-design |
| `skills\frontend-ux\motion-design` | 03-web-and-ui-design |
| `skills\frontend-ux\practical-ui-design` | 03-web-and-ui-design |
| `skills\frontend-ux\webapp-gui-design` | 03-web-and-ui-design |
| `skills\frontend-ux\interaction-design-patterns` | 03-web-and-ui-design |
| `skills\frontend-ux\enterprise-ux-process` | 03-web-and-ui-design |
| `skills\ai\ai-agent-ux` | 03-web-and-ui-design |
| `skills\ai\ai-output-design` | 03-web-and-ui-design |
| `skills\android\android-ui-ux-design` | 06-mobile-ui-ux |
| `skills\ios\ios-ui-ux-design` | 06-mobile-ui-ux |

### From social-media-skills (the `social-media-skills` repository) — 8 skills

| Source skill folder | → Destination group |
|---|---|
| `skills\decks\deck-ai-strategy-presentation` | 02-document-formatting |
| `skills\decks\deck-annual-review` | 02-document-formatting |
| `skills\decks\deck-campaign-proposal` | 02-document-formatting |
| `skills\decks\deck-credentials` | 02-document-formatting |
| `skills\decks\deck-initial-pitch` | 02-document-formatting |
| `skills\decks\deck-monthly-report` | 02-document-formatting |
| `skills\decks\deck-quarterly-review` | 02-document-formatting |
| `skills\decks\deck-strategy-presentation` | 02-document-formatting |

> Note: the 8 decks share a deck-design doctrine but carry social-media-specific content. They
> move as-is in Phase 1; a later pass can extract shared deck-visual doctrine if wanted.

**Phase 1 relief:** engineering-catalog 153 → 142; social-media 184 → 176.

## PHASE 2 — dedup consolidations + visual identity + website portable (medium)

- **Dedup to one canonical copy here, both old homes reference it:**
  - `data-visualization` (engineering-catalog `frontend-ux` + digital-research) → 05-layout-grid-and-data-viz
  - `professional-word-output` (engineering-catalog `product-business` + digital-research) → 02-document-formatting
  - `premium-ui-ux-design` (engineering-catalog `frontend-ux` + website `orchestration`) → 03-web-and-ui-design
  - `form-ux-design` (engineering-catalog `frontend-ux` + website `ux-conversion`) → 03-web-and-ui-design
- **Visual identity (social + website):** `platform-instagram-visual-system`,
  `playbook-social-media-brand-style-guide`, website `brand\brand-style-guide`,
  `build\color-selection`, `brand\brand-alignment` → 04-color-and-visual-identity
- **AI imagery:** social `image-prompt-engineer`, `prompt-library-image-audio-video` → 05.
- **Website portable design knowledge (keep build-coupled in place):** `ux-conversion\ux-psychology`,
  `build\sector-strategies`, `sectors\legal`, `quality-gates\design-quality-score` (rubric) →
  03-web-and-ui-design. **KEEP in website-skills:** `design-system`, `page-builder`, `visual-qa`,
  `website-builder` (build pipeline) — add reference only.
- **business-plan decks:** `meta-pitch\pitch-deck`, `meta-pitch\meta-presentation-design` → 02.
- **digital-research clean moves:** `markdown-lint-cleanup` → 02; `data-visualization` (see dedup).

---

## PHASE 3 — SPLITs + reference wiring (careful)

- **Split (clean seam only):** `tailwind-css` (tokens → design; mechanics stay),
  `avalonia-desktop-development` (XAML theming → design; MVVM stays).
- **Leave + reference (do NOT split):** `react-development`, `nextjs-app-router`,
  `frontend-performance`, `kmp-development`, `pwa-offline-first`, `image-compression`,
  ecommerce/cro/cro-audit, srs `05-ux-specification` design-system half, slop-audit visual gates.
- **Add the trigger block** (integration-plan.md §1) to every engine's CLAUDE.md + AGENTS.md,
  and a row to the user's global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` engine table.

## Status log

- 2026-06-21: manifest approved; Phase 1 beginning (additive copy first, then source deletion).
- 2026-06-21: **Phase 1 COMPLETE.** 19 skills migrated (copied to design engine, then deleted
  from source): 11 from skills-web-dev (frontend-ux design cluster + ai-agent-ux + ai-output-
  design + android/ios UI → groups 03 & 06), 8 deck skills from social-media → group 02.
  skills-web-dev 153→142; social-media 184→176. All 9 engines wired with the portable trigger
  block. (Embedded finance doctrine mirror in skills-web-dev untracked + gitignored.)
- 2026-06-21: **Phase 2 (dedup + website portable) COMPLETE.** 9 canonical skills consolidated
  into the design engine (sources deleted, copies verified): from skills-web-dev —
  data-visualization (canonical 497-line copy), form-ux-design, premium-ui-ux-design; from
  website-skills — color-selection, ux-psychology, brand-style-guide, brand-alignment,
  sector-strategies, legal (→legal-sector-ui-ux); from digital-research — data-visualization dup
  deleted. Website build-coupled skills (design-system, page-builder, visual-qa, website-builder)
  kept + wired to the doctrine; website's orchestration premium-ui-ux-design kept. ~20 name-based
  cross-refs in website resolved via a single relocation note (build pipeline unaffected). Design
  engine now 37 skills. **Deferred:** professional-word-output (blended, near-equal copies in
  skills-web-dev + digital-research — needs a manual content merge, not a blind pick).
- Pending: Phase 3 (tailwind/avalonia clean splits; professional-word-output manual merge).

## PHASE 4 — Convert the FINANCE engine to the reference model (approved 2026-06-21)

Finance is currently MIRRORED (duplicated) into srs-skills, business-plan-skills, proposal-skills,
and skills-web-dev — the same count-inflation/drift problem the design engine avoids. Approved to
convert finance to the reference model like design. Separate, careful phase (finance is large,
~17 skill groups):

1. **Verify** `chwezi-accounting-doctrine` is the complete, current source of every mirrored
   skill/doctrine file (diff each mirror vs source; surface any drift before deleting).
2. **Delete** the mirrored `doctrine/` + `skills/finance/` (and `meta-finance/`,
   `finance-accounting/`) copies from the 4 consumer engines.
3. **Confirm** each engine carries a finance trigger block (global routing already routes finance;
   add a per-engine block mirroring the design one if missing).
4. Retire the finance engine's "Build Once, Mirror Everywhere" integration in favour of references.
5. Update counts. This unifies the whole architecture on "one home per concern, referenced."
